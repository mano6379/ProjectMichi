		<string>Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop was a woman of intelligence, compassion and foresight who understood that her kuleana as a Hawaiian ali‘i was to serve her people.

Pauahi Pākī was born on December 19, 1831 in Honolulu, Hawai‘i to high chiefs Abner Pākī and Laura Kōnia Pākī. She was the great-granddaughter of Kamehameha I, the warrior chief who united the Hawaiian islands under his rule in 1810.

Pauahi was reared with strong Hawaiian values and a bicultural education. She was an excellent student, gifted in music, and known for her generosity and kindness.

At 18, Pauahi married Charles Reed Bishop, a young American businessman who had made his way to the Kingdom of Hawai‘i from Glens Falls, New York. Charles became a pillar in the kingdom government and was a successful businessman, banker and philanthropist. He and Pauahi enjoyed traveling the world with particular fondness for museums and art. With no children of their own, they shared a deep commitment for the well-being and education of kamali‘i — young ones.

As the last royal descendant of the Kamehameha line, Pauahi inherited thousands of acres of land, much of it from the estate of her cousin Princess Ruth Ke‘elikōlani. Her inheritance, about nine percent of the island chain’s total acreage, made Pauahi the largest landholder in the kingdom.</string>
		<string>George Washington Houghtailing (April 7, 1817 – September 2, 1887,) a Dutchman from the Hudson-Mohawk Valley in New York, came to Hawai‘i around 1845. He married a Hawaiian woman in 1850, and ran the Bay Horse Saloon on Bethel and Hotel Street in Honolulu.  (Cultural Surveys)
His first wife died after their daughter Sara was born (Sara married Jerome Feary.) Houghtailing remarried (Elizabeth Thompson) and had ten more children (5-boys and 5-girls,) nine of whom lived to adulthood. During the Māhele, he was given several kuleana, later consolidated into a 15-acre tract along a road later named after him, Houghtailing Road. The family home was between School and Vineyard Streets. “On the premises there was a large pond which had a natural spring and which also fed the lower land where we had taro patches and cultivated the other truck gardening on the land. The land was quite open. We had a couple of bay horses and raised chickens and pigs for family consumption. There was a large open area fronting Houghtailing Road which was used as a park for the neighborhood kids.”  (Houghtailing Jr; Cultural Surveys). Mr. Houghtailing located the ponds, taro fields, and rice patches from School Street to Liliha Street; other taro patches were in the area “between Pālama Street and Liliha Street, below School Street down to what in now Vineyard Street”.

		<string>Sir Peter Buck, in full Sir Peter Henry Buck, original name Te Rangi Hiroa, (born December 15, 1880, Urenui, New Zealand—died December 1, 1951, Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S.), Maori anthropologist, physician, and politician who made major contributions to Maori public health and became one of the world’s leading Polynesian studies scholars. 
The son of William Henry Buck and Ngarongo-ki-tua, a Ngati Mutunga Maori tribeswoman, Buck was a medical officer for Maori health with the New Zealandhealth department (1905–08). He launched a successful drive (1905–14) with Sir Maui Pomare, a fellow member of the Young Maori Party, to improve medical care for Maoris. From 1909 to 1914 he represented the northern Maori constituency in Parliament, serving as minister of the Maori race (1912–14). After duty with the New Zealand medical corps in World War I, he resumed his public health work as director of the division of Maori hygiene for the New Zealand department of health.
Between 1922 and 1927 Buck published a series of scientific papers on Maori life, and in 1927 he became a researcher in Polynesian ethnology for the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. He spent the following 25 years studying and writing about the native Polynesian cultures, becoming director of the Bishop Museum and visiting professor of anthropology at Yale University (1932–34, 1936, 1939). He was knighted in 1946. His books include Vikings of the Sunrise (1938), a survey of Polynesian life, and The Coming of the Maori (1947), his final reflections on the Maoris.</string>

		<string>The street is named for Daniel Paul Rice Isenberg, the son of Paul and Hanna Rice Isenberg. Daniel Isenberg was owner of Wai&apos;alae Ranch; the Wai&apos;alae Golf Course stands on this property. Isenberg was also president of the Mo&apos;ili&apos;ili baseball league, &quot;when the street, leading to the old baseball park, was opened&quot; (03). Isenberg passed away in 1919.</string>
		<string>John Young, famous in island history as fighting companion and advisor of Kamehameha I, is the John Young for whom the present Young Street is named.</string>
		<string>King was frequently referred to as Kawaiahao Street because of the church. When foreigners did not vary these names, the Hawaiians did.</string>
		<string>Queen Kamamalu&apos;s summer cottages stood near the presence site of the Willow&apos;s restaurant on this street. The site was located over lava tubes which formed natural caverns, bringing the fresh water springs from the mountains to the ocean that formed the property’s pools.  Stories say that there was a secret passageway and that the guardian spirit Kane watched over the water sacred to him and gave the place the happy, restful atmosphere.

Because of these many reasons, the Hawaiians found it an ideal spot to grow their taro.  In 1870, Chinese came and settled, planting rice and creating duck ponds.  They were followed by Japanese who found the land ideal for truck farming.

The Willows became the home of Emma McGuire Hausten and her family in the 1920’s.  It was the family’s garden home with beautiful tropical gardens of flora and fauna.  “Ma” Hausten was an avid gardener and planted white ginger, water lilies, plumeria from the South Seas, willow trees, kukui trees, breadfruit and fruit trees as well as Hawaiian herbs and medical plants.  The gardens thrived and people asked if they might use the tropical setting for weddings, luaus and parties.  Finally, in the mid ‘30’s limited private parties were held.  In the years to follow, authentic luaus put on by the family were given and visiting dignitaries and celebrities gathered to experience true Hawaiian hospitality in a home-like atmosphere.</string>
		<string>A number of streets record the memory of men, both Hawaiian and haole, who were prominent in government affairs from the reign of Kamehameha III to the end of that of Queen Liliuo- kalani. Kapaakea, a small lane off Kapiolani Boulevard, com- memorates a high chief by that name, a member of Kamehameha Ill&apos;s Privy Council and father of King Kalakaua. Many scholars have documented that the Queen and her court revelled in the balmy summer water of the nearby Kapa‘akea Springs.</string>
